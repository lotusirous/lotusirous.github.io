      <description>Thought while my code was compiling and being tested I would throw up some thoughts about it. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know you should probably go and read something else, since what follows is going to be pretty technical.
So LINQ to SQL. At first I was totally opposed to it. The idea of taking a language that most developers know (SQL) and morphing it into something that .NET can use and slightly resembles SQL didn&amp;rsquo;t really appeal to me.</description>
